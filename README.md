Data source: https://beta.data.gov.sg/collections/189/view

There are two documents in the repository:
1) The ipynb file is for EDA and testing
2) The .py file is for streamlit application to facilitate price prediction after taking inputs from the user.

Note: The regressor model and some other important files has been transfered from the .ipynb file to the .py file through pickle.
